    Idea is to use stack concept
    Used array [] as stack
    Keep adding item in stack until open brackets found, Keep popping up item if closing bracket found.
    On each pop of item check popped item it should match with the opposite bracket as explained in example else not balanced.

    4 push 4 pop
    {[()()]}
    push {
    push [
    push (
        pop )
    push (
        pop )
        pop ]
        pop }
    gets empty

    2 push 1 pop
    ([)()]
    (
    [
        ) - not matching with [ so not balanced
