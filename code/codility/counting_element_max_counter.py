"""
You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:

        increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
        max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.

A non-empty zero-indexed array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

        if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
        if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4

the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

    (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)

The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

Write a function:

    vector<int> solution(int N, vector<int> &A);

that, given an integer N and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

The sequence should be returned as:

        a structure Results (in C), or
        a vector of integers (in C++), or
        a record Results (in Pascal), or
        an array of integers (in any other programming language).

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4

the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.

Assume that:

        N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N+M);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
