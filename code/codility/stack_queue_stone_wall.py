    Idea is to use stack concept
    Compute the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.
    To build the wall start taking blocks of height one by one.
    We need to take care of -
     - the blocked should not be used again
     - this is done only up to blocks height is greater than current
     - why we are using last 8 height block if there is already 8 height block used in previous step?
        reason is 8 is not present in stack top


    8,
     8,----- can not use because on stack top 8 is already there
      5,
       7,
        9,
         8,
          7,------ can not use because on stack top 7 is already there
           4,
            8,

    This is just example with height, see steps of output for details
