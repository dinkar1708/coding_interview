    Idea-
    Idea is to calculate the prefix some and find out the average as per given formula in this problem and determine
    minimum slice starting index
    # why prefix some? - just to calculate the some between two places without using two loops

    Find min average from P to Q in array and store the minimum index and say it as average of slice from p to q
    Objective is to find minimum average of other slice, the next slice can be [next q+1 and either include  p,q,q+1 p
    or exclude q,q+1]
    We can exclude the slice calculated so far if the current item is less than the average

    :return:  return  1 - starting position of min average
